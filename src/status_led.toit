/**
A driver for an animated LED. 
Sequences of repeated on- and off-phases are used to animate (blink) LEDs.

A blinking LED is used to indicate the system state. 
The shortest blinking consist of an on- and an off-phase. The duration of the phases in milliseconds are kept in a list.
Longer blink sequences are defined in nested lists.
